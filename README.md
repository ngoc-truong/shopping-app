# Shopping Cart
This app was created to learn React routing via react-router-dom. This exercise is part of The Odin Project, an online curriculum to learn web development. 

This app consists of dynamic routing, meaning that clicking a product in a products page will lead to the clicked detail product page. 

Best viewed with Firefox.

# Requirements
- The site has a landing page
- The site has a products page with different products
- When the user clicks on a specific product, the site will open the product's detail page
- When the user clicks on "add to cart", the product will be added to the cart
- The cart should calculate the sum of all chosen products
- In the cart's page, the user should increment/decrement the number of items
